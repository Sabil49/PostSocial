      "tech_rebranding_niche": "To boost engagement for tech/rebranding content, move beyond simple announcements. Focus on analytical posts that discuss the 'why' and 'how' of changes, or the 'what's next' impact on users/businesses. Incorporate visuals, polls, and clear calls-to-action (e.g., 'What are your thoughts on this change?'). Utilize relevant hashtags like #TechTrends, #SocialMediaUpdate, #DigitalTransformation, and consider live Q&A sessions.",
      "general_posts_niche": "Generic greetings like 'Good night' are unlikely to drive engagement for a business or informational account. If the goal is community building, integrate personal touches within a relevant, niche-specific context (e.g., 'Reflecting on a day of tech innovation, good night! What's one tech trend you're excited about?'). Otherwise, focus all content on the core niche to maintain brand consistency and value proposition."

    "tweet_insight_for_niche": "Successful tweets in this niche often provide value through analysis, predictions, how-to guides, or behind-the-scenes insights. They provoke thought, offer solutions to common challenges related to platform changes or tech usage, and invite interaction. Content with engaging visuals (infographics, short videos) and clear calls-to-action performs significantly better than simple announcements.",

    "discussion_topics_for_niche": "Engaging discussions frequently revolve around future predictions, common challenges faced by users/businesses due to tech changes, ethical considerations of new technologies, or comparative analyses of different platforms/tools. Utilizing polls, open-ended questions, and inviting opinions can initiate and sustain these conversations.",
    "tweets_format_for_niche": "Highly effective formats include: multi-tweet threads for in-depth analysis or storytelling; infographics and short videos for quick, digestible information; interactive polls to gather opinions and increase engagement; and short, punchy statements with a strong hook or question. Experiment with platform-specific features like carousels or Spaces.",
    "tweet_strategy_for_niche": {
      "post_day_count": "Consistent daily posting (e.g., 2-5 times) is generally recommended for maintaining audience presence, but quality and relevance should always take precedence over quantity. Distribute evergreen content throughout the week and prioritize immediate posting for breaking news or time-sensitive updates.",
      "post_schedule": "Analyze your target audience's demographics and existing engagement patterns to pinpoint peak activity times. For a global tech audience, consider staggered posting or scheduling for different time zones. Generally, mid-morning to early afternoon on weekdays often yields good results for professional and informational content, but specific audience data is best for fine-tuning."
