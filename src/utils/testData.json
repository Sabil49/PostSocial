Avoid generic or off-topic personal posts. For technical announcements, elaborate on the implications or ask for user opinions to foster discussion. Consistent use of relevant hashtags is also crucial for discoverability and reaching a broader, interested audience."

    "tweet_insight": "Both tweets resulted in zero engagement. The first tweet, though relevant to a tech topic, lacked a clear call to action or engaging perspective. The second tweet ('Good night') is completely off-niche for a tech/business account, leading to irrelevance for its intended audience and failure to generate any interest.",
    "trends_analysis": "While the 'Twitter to X' rebrand was a major trending topic, the tweet about it failed to capture engagement, suggesting the approach was not effective in leveraging the trend to gain visibility or interaction.",
    "hashtags_analysis": "No hashtags were used in either tweet, representing a significant missed opportunity for discoverability and niche targeting within the platform.",
    "keywords_analysis": "Relevant keywords ('blue bird', 'X') were present in one tweet, but not utilized in a way that drove interaction or made the content stand out.",
    "discussion_analysis": "No discussions were successfully initiated or sustained by any of the provided tweets, indicating a failure to spark conversation.",
    "tweets_format": [
      "Tweet 1: Concise text with an emoji and an external link. This format can be effective for sharing news but needs a stronger hook or question to encourage engagement.",
      "Tweet 2: Extremely short, generic text. This format offers no value or engagement potential for a professional or niche-focused account."

      "**Niche Alignment**: Ensure all content directly relates to the tech/business niche to maintain audience relevance and attract the right followers.",
      "**Engagement Hooks**: Integrate questions, polls, or strong opinions into tweets to actively prompt replies and foster discussions.",
      "**Hashtag Strategy**: Consistently use a mix of broad and niche-specific hashtags to improve discoverability and target interested communities.",
      "**Visual Content**: Leverage high-quality images, videos, or GIFs (beyond just links) to make tweets more appealing and increase stopping power.",
      "**Clear Call to Action**: Clearly guide your audience on what you want them to do (e.g., 'What are your thoughts on X?', 'Read more about this trend', 'Vote in our poll').",
      "**Consistent Scheduling**: Implement a planned posting schedule to reach your audience when they are most active and maintain a predictable presence.",
      "**Value Proposition**: Ensure each tweet provides clear value, whether it's insightful information, entertainment, a fresh perspective, or a solution to a problem."
